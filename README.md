# Gitlab Composer repository

Small script that loops through all branches and tags of all projects in a Gitlab installation
and if it contains a `composer.json`, adds it to an index.

This is very similar to the behaviour of Packagist.org

See [example](examples/packages.json).

## Installation

 1. Run `composer.phar install`
 2. Copy `confs/samples/gitlab.ini` into `confs/gitlab.ini`, following instructions in comments
 3. Ensure cache is writable
 4. Change the TTL as desired (default is 60 seconds)
 5. Ensure an alias exists for /packages.json => /packages.php (.htaccess is provided)

## Usage

Simply include a composer.json in your project, all branches and tags respecting 
the [formats for versions](http://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#version) will be detected.

By default, the package `name` must be equal to the path of the project. i.e.: `my-group/my-project`.
This is not a design requirement, it is mostly to prevent common errors when you copy a `composer.json`
from another project without changing its name. To enable support for differences between package names and project
paths, set `allow_package_name_mismatch` to `true` in `confs/gitlab.ini`.

Then, to use your repository, add this in the `composer.json` of your project:
```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "http://gitlab-composer.stage.wemakecustom.com/"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Caveats

While your projects will be protected through SSH, they will be publicly listed.
If you require protection of the package list, [I suggest this reading](https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/doc/articles/handling-private-packages-with-satis.md).
